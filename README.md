# community-maps

If you would like to share Escher maps with the world, you can do it here. Just
make a pull request. We will try to keep maps organized into folders according
to genome-scale model, but the goal is to be less restrictive here than the
[central maps directory](https://github.com/escher/escher.github.io/tree/master/1-0-0/5).

All maps are released into the public domain. See LICENSE.
